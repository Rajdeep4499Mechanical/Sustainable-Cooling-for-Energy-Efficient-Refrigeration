Different PCM ( phase change material) were used to provide refrigeration in means of transportation. After analyzing paraffin was considered as best alternative among all other PCM.
-Conducted Analysis on the Heat flow, temperature distribution and temperature changes at intervals with one cold box featuring phase change materials (PCM)
-Analyzed the design of cold box containing PCM as energy storage, experimented to see the 
efficiency of PCM material and fabricated one cold storage box.
